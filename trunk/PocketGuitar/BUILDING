Building your own PocketGuitar
==============================

*Preparing build environment

Download iPhoneToolchain VMware Image from here, and run it in your VMware.
ftp://ftp.iphonefix.de/iPhoneToolchain%20VMWare%20Image/V2/

Log in as "toolchain" user, and checkout the source code into /PROJECTS/PocketGuitar.
Copy AudioQueue.h included in XCode 3.x into the source directory, and insert following line into the beginning of this file:
#define AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_5_AND_LATER

The compilation will fail when using the default headers in iPhoneToolchain VMware Image V2, so here's a hack to make the build pass:

# mkdir -p /usr/local/arm-apple-darwin/include/Frameworks/CarbonCore.framework
# cd /usr/local/arm-apple-darwin/include/Frameworks/CarbonCore.framework
# ln -s ../../CarbonCore Headers

*Building mpg123

Download mpg123-1.4.0 from http://www.mpg123.de/

 CFLAGS=-DNDEBUG ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/arm-apple-darwin --host=arm-apple-darwin --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
 make
 su
 make install

*Building STK

Download STK from http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/ and extract source code into /PROJECTS/stk-x.x.x

 ./configure --host=arm-apple-darwin --disable-realtime
 cd src; make
 cp libstk.a ../../PocketGuitar/

*Compiling PocketGuitar

Now you should be able to compile the source using "make".

*Converting .wav files into .mp3

Download LAME from http://lame.sourceforge.net/index.php and install it using standard "./configure && make && sudo make install".

./convert_waves.sh

*Creating release package

./package.sh
